## Exercise 1
## a) 80/300 = 26.7%
## b) (95+80)/300 = 58.3%
## c) (300-(120+80))/300 = 33.3%

## Exercise 2
## a) I would say that the data is independent, 
## because gender wouldn't determine what sport is chosen.
## b) (25/120)(24/119) = 4.2%
## (72/120)(71/119) = 35.8%
## c) (31/120)/(85/120) = 18.3%

Exercise 3
P(a) = P(B)P(A|B) + P(not B)P(A|not B)
P(a) = .3

## Exercise 4
## a) 16/50 = 32%
## b) 5/50 = 10%
## c) (45/60)/(3/50) = 4.5%

## Exercise 5
## .3 * .6 = 18% 
## They win a game 18 percent of the time

## Exercise 6
## a) P(X <= 2) = .35
## b) P(X > 1) = .2
## c) E(X) =
